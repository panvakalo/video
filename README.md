# Developer's notes
### Youtube
During this test, only Youtube tests have been used, with the knowledge that other type of videos (Vimeo etc) needed their own way of handling. However for the sake of speed, only this case was covered.

### Vue video player
In order to enable event handling while one video was ending and trigger other actions, npm package `vue-video-player` is used.

### Design
Even though I work with Vuetify, I wanted to experiment with my own mini styling framework, so as to demonstrate SCSS and CSS skills. Therefore, some components might seem too rough, given the time I spent to create them.
